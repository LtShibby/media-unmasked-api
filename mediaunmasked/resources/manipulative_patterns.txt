# ðŸ”¹ Exaggeration & Absolutist Language
\b(all|none|every|always|never)\b
without question
undeniably
beyond a doubt
without a shadow of a doubt
irrefutable proof
inarguable
scientifically proven
guaranteed
no one can deny
absolutely certain
inevitable collapse
completely unprecedented
no alternative but
totally discredited
this changes everything
nothing can stop
without fail
history shows that

# ðŸ”¹ Emotional Manipulation & Loaded Language
the shocking truth
horrifying evidence
dangerously misguided
deeply disturbing
alarming new trend
terrifying reality

crippling consequences

hidden agenda
deliberate deception
reckless policies
radical takeover
secret plot exposed
exposed corruption
will destroy everything
brainwashing the masses
a brutal betrayal
shocking revelations
an unthinkable scenario
must be stopped at all costs
selling out the people

# ðŸ”¹ False Balance & False Equivalencies
both sides are equally to blame
to be fair, some argue
some would say it's just as bad as
on one hand, but on the other hand
many claim thereâ€™s no difference
equally problematic on both sides
critics claim, but supporters argue
itâ€™s just like (unrelated issue)
just as bad as
making the same mistakes
exactly like
history repeating itself

# ðŸ”¹ Implying Authority Without Evidence
leading experts agree
a well-known figure once said
the science is settled
unquestionable truth
indisputable fact
respected authorities confirm
established research shows
a Nobel Prize-winning scientist believes
the most intelligent minds agree
top thinkers of our time argue
those who disagree are uninformed
no real expert would dispute this
a professor from a top university claims
all credible scientists believe
no serious researcher disagrees

# ðŸ”¹ Implying Popular Consensus Without Data
the majority of people think
society agrees that
most intelligent people understand
an overwhelming number of people
the vast majority
widely considered to be true
popular opinion suggests
everyone is talking about
most believe

# ðŸ”¹ Framing Opponents in a Negative Light
only extremists believe otherwise
people who disagree are in denial
anyone who questions this is ignorant
blindly following the agenda
out of touch with reality
desperate attempt to save face
trying to cover up the truth
a last-ditch effort to deceive
refusing to accept facts
spreading misinformation
manipulated by special interests
driven by greed and corruption
being paid to say otherwise
deliberately misleading
hiding the truth from the public
working against the people
exploiting the system
part of the problem, not the solution
dangerous and reckless
acting in bad faith

# ðŸ”¹ Implying Urgency & Fear-Mongering
we are running out of time
before itâ€™s too late
act now before disaster strikes
imminent collapse
crisis is unfolding
ticking time bomb
on the brink of disaster
looming catastrophe
a dire warning
facing an existential threat
the fate of our nation
before it's too late
canâ€™t afford to wait
if this continues, weâ€™re doomed
the last chance to save
history will not be kind
future generations will suffer
too dangerous to ignore

# ðŸ”¹ Appealing to Nostalgia & Past Glory
things were better before
back in the good old days
when America was great
returning to our roots
the way it was meant to be
before things got out of hand
weâ€™ve lost our way
we need to go back to simpler times
what our forefathers intended
traditional values are under attack
restoring the glory days
reclaiming what was lost
remember when things made sense?
back when people had morals
the downfall of our civilization
